#  Classification of dog emotions
 
Developed a machine learning model to classify dog emotions (angry, happy, sad) from images using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes algorithms.
Preprocessed image data by resizing and normalizing, then trained models and evaluated performance using accuracy and confusion matrices.
Achieved better performance with KNN, while Naive Bayes struggled with similar emotional categories, highlighting the importance of dataset quality and size.
